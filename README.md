# Game-of-Life
Game of life a text based adventure game where your decisions effect the outcome of your life. The Aim of the game is to live as long as possible


For this assignment I am hoping to build a game using processing through the Eclipse IDE.

The game will be to survive as long as possible based on decisions you make.
The game will have different resource bars based on a range of lifestyle parameters such as health, wealth and happiness.
The resource bars and answers to previous questions will affect what happens to your character and what questions you get.
I am hoping to publish it on the android appstore as it is something I would like to have on my phone to play.
