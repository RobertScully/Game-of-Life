# Quiz Loader Game

For this assignment I have made a program that will read a specified database of questions and load it into the sketch.

The program will read in all questions in the database and ask the user them one after another. 
The user answers the questions by clicking buttons one of four buttons. If the user answers correctly a green bar that tracks correct answers increases or 
a red bar that tracks incorrect answers increases if the user answers incorrectly.
With the use of a database questions can be added, modified or deleted easily. Because it is a database the quiz can even be entirely changed and it will not
affect the functionality of the program. For example with this program I have written a quiz on the greek gods and goddesses but any quiz or test with four 
possible answers could be used. A multiple choice quiz or test could even be loaded into the database and it would be able to track correct and incorrect answers

For this project I used this library for handling the database connection and for iterating through the database.
